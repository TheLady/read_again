Read Again
==========
This accessible internet 
design project uses 
augmentation and mixed 
modalities to help aging 
readers dealing with 
vision and/or hearing 
loss recover the joy of
reading. 

The goal is to create  
experiences for people who 
love to read but face 
physiological barriers 
that make the written word 
less accessible and 
enjoyable. 

The project explores how
classic and augmented 
technology interfaces 
can make reading joyful,
accessible, and
restorative.

Designers, engineers,
publishers and other 
interested parties: 

Please feel free to push 
your feedback, solutions, 
and ideas upstream.

Preference for oppor-
tunities to implement
Kubernetes, Firebase,
and Python.
